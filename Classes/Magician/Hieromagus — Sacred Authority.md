# 🧿 Hieromagus — Sacred Authority  
*Justice is not spoken. It is cast.* 🔱

> *"I am not a voice for the divine. I am its sentence."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
The Hieromagus is a radiant lawbringer that purifies corruption through divine spells and radiant auras. Their role is hybrid — offense and control — smiting foes who violate sacred zones and reinforcing allies with cleansing light.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
Hieromagi act as executors of holy intent. They do not preach — they radiate clarity. Every cast is a commandment, and each aura a courtroom. There is no appeal, no jury — only light.
