# 🧿 Frostweaver — Voice of Winter  
*Where silence lingers, frost remembers.* 🔱

> *"Time does not stop. It merely forgets to move when I speak."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
The Frostweaver is a precision-based control mage who wields freezing spells and delayed arcane shatter effects. It excels at suppressing enemy movement, spacing, and rhythm through the language of ice and isolation.

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
To the Frostweaver, cold is not a temperature — it's a metaphysical truth. Born of stillness and clarity, they view haste and chaos as weaknesses, and impose winter as a necessary pause for the world to reflect.
