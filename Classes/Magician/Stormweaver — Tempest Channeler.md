# 🧿 Stormweaver — Tempest Channeler  
*To channel the storm is to become its rhythm.* 🔱

> *"Lightning does not wait for permission. Neither do I."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
Stormweaver commands the battlefield through pulsing lightning zones, chaining electric spells, and mastering mobile disruption. It excels at maintaining pressure in open spaces and sweeping multiple targets with elemental arcs.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
Born from raw pressure and sky-borne fury, the Stormweaver is not a conductor of magic — but a pulse within it. They are wanderers who learned to read the heartbeat of weather and transform it into spellform.
