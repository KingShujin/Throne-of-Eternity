# 🧿 Hexweaver — Curse Architect  
*What others call misfortune, I call design.* 🔱

> *"A curse is not random. It is a blueprint for your undoing."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
Hexweaver excels in controlling enemies through entropic hexes and spatial bindings. It crafts lingering zones of decay that trap, weaken, and slowly dismantle enemy defenses while empowering strategic disruption and denial.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
To the Hexweaver, every battlefield is a ritual site. Their curses are laid like latticework — not expressions of anger, but surgical instruments of intent. Their magic is structure, and suffering is simply the result of perfect design.
