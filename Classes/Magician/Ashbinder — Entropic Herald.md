# 🧿 Ashbinder — Entropic Herald  
*Decay is not defeat. It is the truth of persistence.* 🔱

> *"You are not dying. You are dissolving into what you always were."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
The Ashbinder spreads creeping entropy through toxic magic and corroding hexes. A master of rot, they excel in sustained damage-over-time pressure and battlefield softening — turning flesh, magic, and willpower against itself.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
Ashbinders do not fight battles — they watch them expire. To them, life is merely accelerated stillness. Their casting spreads like mold, not as threat but inevitability. Time bends around their presence, and everything with structure begins to flake away.
