# 🧿 Magician — Scribe of the First Glyph  
*Wherever language was born, spellcraft followed.* 🔱

> *"Each glyph is a frozen truth, waiting for the right moment to be read."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
The Magician is the source code of all Soulforms — a glyph-wielding channeler who stabilizes arcane fields and builds spell interactions through elegant control. It is not a master of destruction, but the framework upon which power is transcribed.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
The Magician is a linguist of cosmic architecture. Their spells aren't bursts — they are blueprints. Whether on parchment or air, their glyphs record potential, and their presence always whispers "this is where magic began."
