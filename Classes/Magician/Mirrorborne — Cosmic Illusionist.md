# 🧿 Mirrorborne — Cosmic Illusionist  
*Nothing is false. Only delayed.* 🔱

> *"What you strike is already elsewhere."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
The Mirrorborne is an arcane illusionist who distorts space and memory — creating mirrored doubles, casting phantasmal spells, and reflecting enemy magic back upon its source. A master of confusion and misdirection, the Mirrorborne thrives in chaos and reactive disruption.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
Mirrorborne are cosmic tricksters, philosophical reflectionists who believe that reality is only as stable as we accept it to be. They do not destroy or corrupt — they *rearrange*. They wield light like narrative, telling stories with spells you think you understand.
