# 🧿 Bloodglyph — Sanguine Sigilist  
*Power is not given. It is written in suffering.* 🔱

> *"My health is not a cost. It is the ink."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
Bloodglyph is a sigilist who etches reality using their own lifeforce — empowering their spells by sacrificing health and engraving blood-bound magic into enemies. They are high-risk, high-utility hybrid casters with vampiric sustain and glyph detonations.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
The Bloodglyph is a martyr-mage, a chronicler of pain who inscribes truths in sacrifice. Where others reserve power, they convert agony into authority — wielding hemorrhage, sigils, and vital binding as language.
