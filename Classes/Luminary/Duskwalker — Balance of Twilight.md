# 🧿 Duskwalker — Balance of Twilight 🌒  
*Equilibrium Caster* 🔱

> *"We are the moment between breath and silence — both are sacred."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
_The Duskwalker walks the razor-thin edge between day and night. This is a class of toggled polarity, capable of flipping between radiant empowerment and void denial. Mastery lies in reading the moment — and pivoting with purpose._

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
_Built on the doctrine of celestial neutrality, Duskwalkers are guardians of transitions — spiritual, elemental, and moral. They believe every force finds its mirror, and the true mage is one who sees both sides at once._

### 🜂 Discipline: Twilight Edge

- Moonfade: Enter stealth for 3s if polarity switches twice in 10s

◈◈◈◈
### 🜃 Discipline: Ecliptic Doctrine
**Theme**: _Balance as cosmic truth_  
**Playstyle**: _Shifts tempo of battle — punish momentum or slow pacing_

## 🌀 Final Meta-Check

1. **Could this class carry a raid in the right hands?**  
→ Yes — especially in duels or reactive raid roles. Timing mastery unlocks devastating synergy.

2. **What would a master duelist hate about fighting this class?**  
→ They’re hard to lock down — polarity shifts break burst chains or flip healing into damage.

3. **If this class were a god, what would its doctrine be?**  
→ All light casts shadow. All night yearns for dawn. We do not choose sides — we preserve the dance between.
