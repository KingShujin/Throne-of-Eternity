# 🧿 Ruinvoker — Beacon of Collapse 💀  
*Decay Caster* 🔱

> *"Where others see endings, I see the beginning of truth."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
_The Ruinvoker channels entropy and collapse into a strategic deluge of rot-based magic. This class specializes in soulburn, corruption zones, and inevitable withering — a slow-motion death sentence for everything it touches._

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
_Ruinvokers are nihilist philosophers who view decay as the final honesty. They spread collapse like a doctrine, dismantling the illusions of permanence with every cast._

_Excels at wearing down fortified enemies, collapsing formations over time. Best when left uninterrupted to layer rot fields and soul drains._

◈◈◈◈

## 🔻 Weaknesses

◈◈◈◈

- Unleashes a 10m field of spreading decay for 10s
- Applies stacking rot (Soulburn) every 2s

## 🧭 Disciplines

Each Discipline is a mastery path — a specialization that redefines how the class performs its core function. These are **not passive trees**, but **playstyle-defining frameworks**.

### 🜂 Discipline: Blightcaller
**Theme**: _Ruin through overgrowth_  
**Playstyle**: _Lays down expanding corruption fields_  
**Identity**: _For siege casters who want battlefield denial_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Blight Bloom: Corruption fields expand +25% over 6s
- Sporespike: Damage increases based on duration of enemy infection
- Wither Pulse: Hits from within blight zones slow enemy cast speed

◈◈◈◈
### 🜁 Discipline: Soulleecher
**Theme**: _Decay as healing_  
**Playstyle**: _Sustains through rot siphoning and spirit theft_  
**Identity**: _Ideal for sustain-focused casters who trade health for power_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Lifebane Link: 20% of rot damage restores health
- Bloodrust: Critical hits on decayed enemies restore Spirit
- Soul Veil: Immune to stuns while inside rot zones

◈◈◈◈
### 🜃 Discipline: End Doctrine
**Theme**: _Philosophy of dissolution_  
**Playstyle**: _Alters win conditions — rewards long fights and collapse_  
**Identity**: _For thinkers who view combat as inevitable decline_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Entropy Clock: All buffs expire 20% faster near you
- Collapse Dividend: Gain Resolve per unit of decay damage done
- Doctrine Trigger: Ultimate resets cooldown if 3 enemies die in it

## 🌀 Final Meta-Check

1. **Could this class carry a raid in the right hands?**  
→ Yes — in endurance fights or boss phases with adds. Not an opener, but the finisher of worlds.

2. **What would a master duelist hate about fighting this class?**  
→ Rot pressure forces movement, healing, or death. They’re frustrating if you can’t clear DoTs fast.

3. **If this class were a god, what would its doctrine be?**  
→ Nothing endures. All things rot. Ruinvokers merely hasten nature’s truest law — the supremacy of collapse.
