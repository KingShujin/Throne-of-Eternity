*Radiant Support & Strategic Hybrid* 🔱

> *"Even the darkest battlefields bloom under sacred light."* ⚜️

## 🧭 Disciplines

Each Discipline is a mastery path — a specialization that redefines how the class performs its core function. These are **not passive trees**, but **playstyle-defining frameworks**.

### 🜂 Discipline: Radiant Core
**Theme**: _Unleashed light_  
**Playstyle**: _Burst empowerment and direct zone judgment_  
**Identity**: _For players who want maximum impact and presence control_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Radiant Nova: Unleashes AoE light explosion on Spirit spike
- Blessed Marks: Allies marked by you gain 15% bonus healing from all sources
- Solar Conduction: Radiant zones now trigger secondary pulses

◈◈◈◈
### 🜁 Discipline: Wardbearer
**Theme**: _Shielding devotion_  
**Playstyle**: _Sustained aura-based defense and rescue casting_  
**Identity**: _For defensive tacticians who protect formation integrity_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Sanctum Pulse: Periodically emits a barrier around allies every 10s
- Halo Drift: Slow aura follows you, granting gradual healing
- Martyr’s Grace: Can take 30% of an ally's damage for 5s

◈◈◈◈
### 🜃 Discipline: Path of Benediction
**Theme**: _Doctrine of radiance as morality_  
**Playstyle**: _Philosophical layer that shifts from support to judgment_  
**Identity**: _For lore-leaning players who blend offense and doctrine_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Blessing//Judgment Toggle: Switch between buff-focused or damage-focused auras
- Solar Creed: Regenerate 2% Spirit when allies are healed
- Beacon of Law: Ultimates leave behind an 8s light zone that burns enemies

## 🌀 Final Meta-Check

1. **Could this class carry a raid in the right hands?**  
→ Yes, in coordinated hands. High-skill utility stacking and zone prediction allow near-unparalleled raid presence.

2. **What would a master duelist hate about fighting this class?**  
→ Radiant pulses and toggled auras can punish aggression, especially when auras self-heal or reverse damage unexpectedly.

3. **If this class were a god, what would its doctrine be?**  
→ Light reveals, heals, and judges. The Luminary lives by divine structure — every action illuminates truth or burns falsehood.
