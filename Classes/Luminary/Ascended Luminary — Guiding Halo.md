## 🧭 Disciplines

Each Discipline is a mastery path — a specialization that redefines how the class performs its core function. These are **not passive trees**, but **playstyle-defining frameworks**.

### 🜂 Discipline: Echoflare
**Theme**: _Mirrored radiance_  
**Playstyle**: _Turns each offensive cast into twin impact moments_  
**Identity**: _For aggressive support players who still want burst options_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Flashback: Light spells re-cast themselves 1.5s later for 50%
- Dawn Ripple: Basic attacks trigger a 3m pulse of Radiant damage
- Crisis Cast: Healing spells crit if ally below 30%

◈◈◈◈
### 🜁 Discipline: Sanctuary Weaver
**Theme**: _Protective harmonics_  
**Playstyle**: _Weaves layered safety into every action_  
**Identity**: _For timing-heavy supports who enjoy pre-emptive defense_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Delay Ward: Grants 2s delayed barrier after receiving healing
- Soundless Bastion: Enemies inside aura have reduced crit chance
- Purelight Anchor: Prevents ally knockback and pull effects

◈◈◈◈
### 🜃 Discipline: Light’s Judicant
**Theme**: _Philosophy of righteous recursion_  
**Playstyle**: _Executes calculated rotation that rewards repetition_  
**Identity**: _Strategists and loop-players who love high reward from pattern play_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Virtue Stack: Buffs that land consecutively increase duration by 10%
- Sacred Pattern: After 3 unique casts, next one is free
- Cycle of Grace: Ult refreshes 25% faster if used post-ally ult

## 🌀 Final Meta-Check

1. **Could this class carry a raid in the right hands?**  
→ Yes — not through raw power, but perfect orchestration of the raid’s potential.

2. **What would a master duelist hate about fighting this class?**  
→ Echo effects and preloaded wards make windows hard to read; frustrating for burst assassins.

3. **If this class were a god, what would its doctrine be?**  
→ True light is not command — it is invitation. The Ascended Luminary teaches that power shared is power multiplied.
