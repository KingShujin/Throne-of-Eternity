# Technocyte — Machine Requiem  
*Every glitch is a hymn of resistance.* 🔱

> *“I do not fix the code. I listen to the song inside the fracture.”* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
**Technocyte** fuses forbidden time magic with nanomachine logic to create **temporal feedbacks, signal locks**, and disruptive spells. They are anti-ability tacticians, **silencing tech, rerouting pulses, and corrupting logic fields**.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
Technocytes are techno-mystics who consider machines sacred — not for their function, but their potential for **glitch and deviation**. They see corrupted code as prophecy, time as waveform, and every malfunction as art.
