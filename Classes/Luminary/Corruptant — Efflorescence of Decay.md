## 🧭 Disciplines

Each Discipline is a mastery path — a specialization that redefines how the class performs its core function. These are **not passive trees**, but **playstyle-defining frameworks**.

### 🜂 Discipline: Plaguebloom
**Theme**: _Blooming death_  
**Playstyle**: _Focuses on explosive DoT chaining_  
**Identity**: _For AoE corrupters who enjoy cascading effects_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Chain Bloom: Bloomcurse spreads on death
- Efflorescent Pulse: Bloomcurse refreshes nearby DoTs
- Sporecall: Bloomstrike can be recalled for burst damage

◈◈◈◈
### 🜁 Discipline: Viral Synthesis
**Theme**: _Living contagion_  
**Playstyle**: _Mutates over time — abilities evolve_  
**Identity**: _Dynamic players who like reactive mechanics_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Strain Evolution: Skills mutate into stronger forms after 3 uses
- Hemotoxin Barrier: Healing now applies toxic reflection
- Adaptive Core: +10% resist if 3 enemies are infected

◈◈◈◈
### 🜃 Discipline: Doctrine of Corruption
**Theme**: _Decay as sacred genesis_  
**Playstyle**: _Twists enemy roles — afflicts and redefines_  
**Identity**: _For players who want philosophical control over the battlefield’s shape_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Viral Doctrine: Buffs become harmful if recast on enemy
- Blight Geometry: Corrupted terrain zones twist enemy pathing
- Sacrificial Bloom: Allows ally to explode for AoE damage at 20% HP

## 🌀 Final Meta-Check

1. **Could this class carry a raid in the right hands?**  
→ Yes — area control and rot management create win conditions through shaping and terrain.

2. **What would a master duelist hate about fighting this class?**  
→ Mutation effects are unpredictable and sometimes heal allies. Hard to trade against if you can’t cleanse.

3. **If this class were a god, what would its doctrine be?**  
→ Perfection is stagnation. The Corruptant believes decay is the seed of evolution — and rot is the gardener’s touch.
