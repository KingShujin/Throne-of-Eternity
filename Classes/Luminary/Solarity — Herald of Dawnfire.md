# Solarity — Herald of Dawnfire  
*The first blaze that breaks the night.* 🔱

> *“The sun does not ask permission to rise.”* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
**Solarity** is a midline charger and motivator — igniting battle tempo through solar strikes, radiant aura bursts, and fire-based forward pressure. Meant for *momentum generation*, it bridges DPS and inspiration support with bright, aggressive flare.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
Solarity are not passive torchbearers — they are the sun's spear. Each charge forward is a declaration of purpose, a challenge to the hesitant. Their flame does not flicker — it commands.
