# 🧿 Phoenixborne — Ember Reclaimer 🔥  
*Rebirth Caster* 🔱

> *"I do not end. I become."* ⚜️

_Phoenixborne are flame’s memory — casters who wield death not as defeat, but as ignition. They are the masters of post-mortem value, resurrection bursts, and strategic collapse-rebirth cycles._

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
_Phoenixborne are the living myth of eternal return. They wield finality like a flare, embracing destruction as the fuel of transcendence. They do not fear death — they budget for it._

## 🧭 Disciplines

Each Discipline is a mastery path — a specialization that redefines how the class performs its core function. These are **not passive trees**, but **playstyle-defining frameworks**.

### 🜂 Discipline: Blazereaper
**Theme**: _Living inferno_  
**Playstyle**: _Massive AoE flame caster_  
**Identity**: _For players who want to be the literal spark of battle_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Inferno Bloom: Enemies ignited explode on death
- Ash Mantle: Gain Flame resist and Spirit regen during burn
- Combust Trigger: On receiving lethal hit, detonate before falling

◈◈◈◈
### 🜁 Discipline: Kindled Heir
**Theme**: _Rebirth memory_  
**Playstyle**: _Delayed power — grows stronger post-death_  
**Identity**: _For those who turn loss into leverage_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Phoenix Gauge: Fills when healing allies or taking damage
- Legacy Ignition: On revival, buffs ally spell power by 15%
- Heir’s Bond: Auto-resurrects 1 ally if you die within 10m of them

◈◈◈◈
### 🜃 Discipline: Doctrine of Return
**Theme**: _Death is cycle, not end_  
**Playstyle**: _Orchestrated death loops and tradeoffs_  
**Identity**: _Philosophical tacticians who see value in every collapse_  

Sample Mechanics:
- Resurgent Cycle: Can Rebirth twice per encounter if spaced 45s apart
- Ashes to Origin: Every death lowers cooldowns of all allies by 10s
- Fate-Burn Law: If revived, all enemies nearby are burned for 5s

◈◈◈◈

## 🌀 Final Meta-Check

1. **Could this class carry a raid in the right hands?**  
→ Yes — if allowed to fall and return. Their control over defeat-rebirth rhythm can swing major engagements.

2. **What would a master duelist hate about fighting this class?**  
→ They cheat death. A perfect finisher is punished by a comeback nova — frustrating to lock out cleanly.

3. **If this class were a god, what would its doctrine be?**  
→ Death is not failure — it is the prelude to greatness. The Phoenixborne teaches that flame is memory, and memory always returns to burn brighter.
