# 🧿 Scholar — Epitome of Knowing  
*Every spell is merely an annotated truth.* 🔱

> *"To learn is to wield the shape of all things."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
The Scholar is the root of cerebral magic — an arcane technician that manipulates spells through classification, prediction, and logical enhancement. It bridges support, control, and analysis in equal measure.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
Scholars are archivists of existence, dissecting phenomena into spellform. They do not believe in power — only knowledge properly arranged. In battle, they observe, catalog, and rewrite.
