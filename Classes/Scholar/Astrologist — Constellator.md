# 🧿 Astrologist — Constellator  
*Every moment written above becomes law below.* 🔱

> *"The stars do not predict. They declare."* ⚜️

◈◈◈◈

**Summary**:  
The Astrologist wields the sky as spellbook — drawing constellations into the battlefield and invoking stellar forces. They control the pace of battle with slow-fused effects, time-synced pulses, and map-wide pressure.

◈◈◈◈

## 🧩 Narrative Identity  
Astrologists read not the future, but the structural blueprint of potential. They do not ask the stars for permission — they enact their geometric will.
